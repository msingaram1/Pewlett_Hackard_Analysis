# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to first, create a table with the number of retiring employees sorted by job title as well as create a table which will determine which employees are eligible for mentorship. 

## Results
 - In the first deliverable, we first created a query to create a retirement titles table for employees born between Jan 1, 1952 & December 31, 1955.

 - Then we created a unique titles list that contains the employee number, first and last name, and most recent title:

  - Finally, saw the number of employees under specific job titles were retiring as follows:

 - We can see that the most job titles are senior engineers, followed shortly by senior staff, and then at a lot less is engineer at 3rd place and staff close by at 4th

 - In the second deliverable we were able to determine which employees were mentorship elegible:

## Summary
